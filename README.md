== PUT Chat

The project was realized on Operating Systems classes. It's a simple client - server app written in C which enables the user to:

- log in to a server
- show the list of users from all servers
- send messages to a user
- send messages to all users
- register in a room
- send messages to users in the room
- show the list of rooms
- change the room
- log out

There are up to 15 servers - every server is able to host 20 users. Server can kick the user off if something went wrong and the user is not responding.
